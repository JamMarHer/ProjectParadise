# Project Paradise \[Planning\]

#### User Flow
* How are users onboarded to the platform?
* Are users given an overview to the platform?
  * Then the user first creates an account, a light and concise tutorial should be presented. Similar to scrolling through fragments.
* Are users subscribed to waves at default?
  * A good way to introduce the user into the concept of waves is to present to them (maybe in the tutorial) a list of trending waves that they can start riding. 
* How should users find the waves they want to ride?
  * The explore fragment should take care of that. More about it below.
* How are users retained on the platform?
  * Chats & the idea of groups. Making chats & groups a key idea of waves is expected to make the user want to return. Chats & groups are key because sharing waves of interests or/and content in the same plataform helps build a better relation with the "brand".

#### Waves
* What should be important to the users on this app?
  * Their content is sectioned by topic/group of people. Therefore the approach add an extra layer of privacy. 
* Are waves managed by admins or are they decentralized?
  * Decentralized.
* Is it importatnt for users to be a part of many waves or have more engagement to waves?
* Is there a chatroom for each wave?
  * Yes, and this adds the problem of scalability.
* What's the difference between using the chat and the wave?
  * Waves are extreamly sectioned, to the degree that each post has its own fragment. 
* How do you create content in a wave?
  * Hit that + button next to the name of the wave.
* What if a content belongs to multiple waves?
  * No big deal as long as the content represents the likings of the participants.
* Will content be available on multiple waves?
  * Something to look into. 
* Will users see content multiple times if it is shared in multiple waves?
  * Yes.
* What would be a use case of sub-waves?
  * Working on it. 
* Are waves exclusive? Meaning there are waves that are private, secret, or public?
  * Yes. Private waves cannot be accessed from the explore feature. 
* Will there be a notification feature for each wave?
  * Not per post, but maybe add a notification after certain number of posts are made. 

#### Explore
* How are waves curated on the explore feature? Specically, what kind of metrics will you collect to curate the explore feature?
* How are waves previewed to users?
* Is there a search feature?

#### Chat
* Will it end-to-end encryption?
* What will you be able to send using chat? Pictures? GIFs? Location?
* Will there be group messages or just DM?

#### Data/Architecture
* What is the current data architecture? What is ideal?
* How will content be loaded in a wave? How will data retrival be handled on each wave? What will be cached?
* What kind of data schemas are used?
