foli transforms the current social media model into a more filtered and controllable environment. foli is a mobile application that is currently in development.

A good analogy to put into perspective our vision is to picture the internet as a sea of ideas and trends. Sometimes when you search the web, you get hit by content that you don't want to deal with.
Instead of tolerating irrelevant/offensive/random content, what if you could select the kind of content you want to ride. Hence the concept of **waves**, a form of a profile that contained content that interests you.

## Use case, people:
Imagine having three different **_waves_**: family, school, and friends.
- **Family**: This wave contains people that are only part of your family. All of the content being shared here is only relevant to you and to each of the present. Unlike other social media where content isn't sectioned out from your faimly, **_waves_** can give you the advantage of keeping your social platforms _wholesome_ ♥️. 
- **School**: Whether a user is in high school or in college, there is something good about being part of a group. Let's say one of your school's clubs is having a meetup. Publishing the announcement in the school's **_wave_** can reach a larger audience. This is more likely to reach a larger audience because when students use their school's wave, they expect what content to engage with; therefore less predisposed to dismiss it. 
- **friends**: Now here is the were the concept of **_waves_** shine the most. Each person carries a different wavelength when describing personality. Different waves for different group of friends. It's all about the inside jokes.

There's a distinction between a wave and a groupchat. It's not common to have groupchat's with strangers, but in foli, strangers would a ride waves with you (cool strangers).
Waves are more than a physical collective of people. They can also represent ideas and topics.

## Use case, topics/ideas:
When people generate ideas and believe its relevance, they tend share it on the internet. The problem is that some of those ideas might no longer interest us, or we may easily dismiss them due to bad timing. It doesn't help that the internet holds such a gigantic amount of information that it overwhelms us from time to time. Now, imagine that you are riding two waves: conspiracy theories and sloths.
There's no reason why a sloth and conspiracy theories should go together, unless you decide to make a wave for sloths and conspiracy theories :poop:.

## Current State of the App:
Currently the app layout is divided into four fragments:
- **Me**: Displays username, numbers of waves, contacts and a list of the waves that the user is part of.
- **Wave**: Is meant to hold the actual content of the wave. This being posts, etc.
- **Explore**: Here is were the user is going to engage with new sources of content. Explore has a **_curated_** list of publi global and local waves available to join. 
- **Chat**: Holds the chat rooms that the user has engaged in.

## Looking Forward:
Idea currently being contemplated based on each fragment.
- **Wave**: With the idea in mind of keeping the user engaged, I'll like to introduce the concept of sub-wave. When the user is inside a wave, it will allow it to swipe through the different sub-waves (topics). Such sub-waves can have temporary life or not. More to expand later. 

## Getting Started
Currently, foli is only being developed for Android. So is doesn't matter what OS you are running, Android Studio should work fine.

### Prerequisites
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)


### Installation
After installing Android studio, download the project using the project's GitHub link. Android studio offers an easy integration with github to complete this step.
Inside Android Studio do the following:
- Go to **File**->**New**->**Project from Version Control**->**_GitHub_**.
- After loggin in, if you have permission (Duh if you are seeing this you do) select ProjectParadise from the URL options (_https://github.com/JamMarHer/ProjectParadise_).
- Click on Clone.

After installing, foli should be ready for testing and development.

## Running

After clonning the project, give it a run in the emulator. foli is currently being tested with an emulated phone _running on Android P, on a Pixel 2 XL_.
It is also being tested on a Samsung Galaxy S9+ running Android P.
The Android emulator comes included with Android Studio but if you want more info, [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator) is the link.
