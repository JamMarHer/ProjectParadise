# foli (Project Paradise)

foli is a mobile application currently in development. The idea behind foli is to transform the current social media model into a more filtered and controllable environment.
A good analogy to put into perspective our vision is to picture the internet as sea of ideas and trends, some times as you are surfing the web you get hit by content that you don't want to deal with.
What if instead of randomly getting with by irrelevant/offensive/random content you could select which **_waves_** of content you want to ride. Hence the concept of waves, a wave represents a profile for 
the content that you are interested in. 

## Use case, people:
Imagine having three different **_waves_**: family, school, and friends.
- **Family**: This wave contains people that are only part of your family, all the content being shared here is relevant to you and to each of the present. Having family sectioned out compared to other social 
media, gives you the advantage of keeping it wholesome. 
- **school**: No matter if the user is in High School or College, there's something good about being part of a group. Let's say one of your school's clubs is having a meetup. Publishing the announcement in the school's
wave, allows for a greater attention. the reason for this is that when someone log's in to the shool's wave that person already knows what content its going to engage with, therefore less predisposed to dismiss it. 
- **friends**: Now here is the were the concept of waves shine the most. Each person carries a different wavelength when describing personality. Different waves for different group of friends. It's all about the inside jokes.

There's a distinction between a wave and a groupchat. It's not common to have groupchat's with strangers, in foli strangers would a ride waves with you (cool strangers).
Waves are more than a fisical group of people, they can also represent ideas and topics.

## Use case, topics/ideas:
People generate ideas and when they believe is relevant enough they could share it in the internet. The problem is that some of those ideas might no longer interest us, or simply due to wrong timming we easily dismiss them. It doesn't help that the internet hold such a gigantic amount of information that can overwhelm us, time to time. Now imagine you have two waves: conspiracy theories and sloths.
There's no reason why a sloth and conspiracy theories should go together, unless you decide to make a wave for sloths and conspiracy theories :poop:.


## Getting Started
Currently foli is only being developed for Android. So is doesn't matter what OS you are running it Android Studio should work fine.

- Click on Clone.

After installing, foli should be ready for testing and development.

## Running

After clonning the project give it a run in the emulator. foli is currently being tested with an emulated phone _running on Android P, on a Pixel 2 XL_.
It is alo being tested on a Samsung Galaxy S9+ running Android P.
The Android emulator comes included with Android Studio but if you want more info, [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator) is the link.
